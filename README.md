# About the Course
This is the definitive, hands-on Cybersecurity Training program designed for aspiring Digital Forensic Investigator and Incident Response analysts seeking an Expert Certification in advanced digital analysis.

The ImperaCert Digital Autopsy Expert course provides comprehensive, practical training focused on mastering the open-source Autopsy Digital Forensics Tool, built upon the rigorous framework of The Sleuth Kit. This intensive training goes beyond basic tool usage, covering the entire end-to-end DFIR process: from forensically sound data acquisition to the generation of a Court-Admissible Forensic Report.

You will gain essential hands-on experience using live tools and real-world scenarios, including complex investigations like a digital autopsy (suicide case). A core competency of this course is Deleted File Recovery, teaching advanced techniques like File Carving to retrieve critical evidence from unallocated space. Furthermore, you will master Keyword Search techniques and deep metadata analysis required for reconstructing complex user timelines.

Crucially, this course specializes in the high-demand, niche areas of analysis:

Mobile Forensics: Learn advanced data extraction and analysis from Android Forensics and iOS Forensics devices, covering popular applications and filesystem structures.

Emerging Technologies: Become proficient in UAV Forensics and Drone Forensics Analysis, extracting and mapping flight logs and operational data required for criminal justice proceedings.

By blending mastery of the Autopsy Digital Forensics Tool with skills vital for Threat Hunting and enterprise-level Incident Response, this Digital Forensics Certification validates your expertise, ensuring you are prepared to tackle the most challenging digital investigations and secure significant career growth. Upon completion, you will receive a professional certification, confirming your proficiency as a Digital Autopsy Expert.

The learning objectives are designed to align with the Application, Analysis, and Synthesis levels of cognitive learning, ensuring graduates possess actionable, job-ready skills rather than just theoretical knowledge. The course emphasizes hands-on experience with live tools and example files, which is universally recognized by experts as essential for effective forensic education. <br>

A. Foundational Forensic Methodology and Autopsy Mastery

Students who complete the ImperaCert Digital Autopsy Expert course will master the following objectives:

Install and configure the Autopsy digital forensics platform and integrate necessary plug-ins and associated modules, including understanding the underlying architecture provided by The Sleuth Kit, to create a fully functional, professional Digital Forensics workstation.

Analyze digital evidence according to the internationally recognized DFIR process model: Identification, Preservation, Examination, Analysis, and Reporting. This includes applying best practices for data acquisition methodology and evidence collection to ensure forensic soundness.

Demonstrate proficiency in creating and managing forensic cases within Autopsy, accurately documenting the chain-of-custody and handling digital evidence to maintain integrity throughout the investigation.

Distinguish between volatile and non-volatile data sources, mastering techniques for gathering crucial information from various operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac) and different file system types. <br>

B. Advanced Digital Artifact Analysis and Data Retrieval

The course provides deep technical skills necessary for reconstructing complex digital timelines and user activity:

Execute high-level and targeted keyword searches across entire disk images and file systems, utilizing Autopsy’s dedicated keyword module and regular expressions to quickly identify files and metadata containing specific terms critical for investigation.

Recover and reconstruct comprehensive user activity timelines by analyzing crucial system artifacts, including event logs, recent activity records, web browser history, and application caches, enabling the reconstruction of past events in complex investigations.

Apply advanced techniques such as File Carving to effectively retrieve files and fragments from unallocated space, slack space, and swap files, thereby maximizing deleted file recovery and overcoming anti-forensics techniques.

Evaluate data integrity and authenticate all digital evidence by systematically employing cryptographic file hashing (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) and data validation methodologies to ensure the collected evidence is reliable and verifiable. <br>

C. Specialized Device Forensics (Mobile and UAV)

A significant component of the course focuses on specialized, complex data sources:

Extract and analyze application data, filesystem structure, and communications artifacts from leading mobile operating systems, including Android and iOS devices. This includes proficiency in analyzing widely used applications such as social media and messaging services (e.g., WhatsApp, Google Chrome) for retrieving critical data.

Investigate and process digital evidence obtained from UAV (Drone Forensics). Students will learn to locate, extract, and interpret data from flight controllers, linked mobile devices, and external memory cards using industry-recognized forensic software.

Map and visualize drone flight paths, registered user information, and operational history using extracted metadata, enabling crucial geographical and chronological analysis to support criminal justice proceedings. <br>

D. Legal Reporting and Investigative Conclusion

The ability to generate documentation that withstands legal scrutiny is the defining feature of an Expert certification:

Generate comprehensive, professional, and legally sound forensic reports that clearly articulate investigative methodology, findings, and conclusions for both technical specialists and non-technical legal counsel.

Evaluate the legal admissibility of acquired digital evidence, ensuring all investigative steps meet procedural rigor and satisfy requirements such as the Daubert Standard. This is particularly vital when utilizing open-source tools like Autopsy, requiring the ability to prove repeatability and reliability comparable to commercial solutions.

Present and defend investigative findings in scenario-based exercises, such as analyzing digital evidence in a digital autopsy (suicide case) context, detailing the methodology, conclusions, and integrity of the evidence chain to an audience that may include judicial or organisational leadership. </br>
